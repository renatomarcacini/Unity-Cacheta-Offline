[[Gameplay video]](https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7205990112206163969?compact=1)

Cacheta is a popular card game in Latin America. This repository was created as a template to demonstrate the application of various common patterns in game development with Unity 3D. Additionally, it includes a basic example of implementing the Unity Test Framework.

The patterns used in this project are:

- PubSub 
- State Machine (UI Controller)
- Strategy Pattern (AI)
- Singleton

Repository containing the collection of patterns and usage examples: [Unity-System-Patterns](https://github.com/renatomarcacini/Unity-System-Patterns)

As this is an example project, not all GameFeel and rules of Cacheta are applied.

What is missing:
- Rule of the "vira" and wild cards (jokers).
- Rule of winning with the discard of the opponent's card.
- Soundtrack and sound effects.
